## ⏱️ Time Spent

It took me around 12 hours to complete the task. Although this is a bit long for a simple task, I come from an Angular background, so I took extra time to understand React concepts and best practices.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Built with **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **SCSS**.
- The main page is implemented in the `TaskDashboard.tsx` component.
- Used **Context API** for state management. Only one context was needed to manage the dashboard state.

## ✅ Bonus Points
